What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It will create a repository. You need to create in order to compile the files of your application in to a repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is where all the files of your repository are located. You can then add specific files from the working directory to the staging area, where it can be packaged into a commit into the repository.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use git diff -staged to compare the most current commit and the files in the staging area to see what is going to be changed. Thus you can see if there will only be one logical change before committing
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Some situations would be when you are about to create an experimental feature, or another language version, or a drastic change. Branches help separate the branches from the master, and allow it to be more orgainzed an later merged to the master if successful
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
As you progress with your repository, there will be countless branches, new commits in detached heads, new branches, and thus to help with all the branches and to see the reachabiliy of the commits, drawing a diagram will help see the full picture.
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
merging two branches together will create  a single branch (master branch if merged with the master branch) that contains all the commits of both branches within reachability. We represent it in the diagram because it is essentially combining the two branches but the final merged branch contains all the merged commits.
