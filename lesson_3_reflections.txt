When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In the instance that you lose all your files locally, you have it up on Github. Also for other people to see and contribute to projects you have put up publically.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be times when your remote repository is in the middle of finsihing something, or a new unit of work wasn't finished. There is also the fact that the remote repository may have many different contributors adding onto the repository, and thus you want to be able to choose when to manually pull

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

a fork is when you copy a repository from github to github
clones is when you copy a repository, either from local to local, or github to local
a branch is when you create a new commit that you want separate from the master commit to either test features or bug test

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is beneficial so that you can have it locally in case you would want to work on it withot internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

some ways to collabrate will be to always exchange copies of the repositories (prgorams). It will be easier to change things one at a time, but it will extremely hard to compile different contributions like you can with branches and mergin.
